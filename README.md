# SolarSteps (weather-connected pedometer)

### Goal
To develop innovative energy-efficient application pedometer to count calories using meteoservisov weather data.

### Tasks
Examine existing measurement algorithms steps and distance using sensors embedded in the smartphone (gyroscope, accelerometer). To study the essence of Harris Benedict formula and use it to calculate the total amount of calories burned, depending on the duration of sleep, number of steps you've taken, and most importantly, on the ambient temperature.


### The essence of the study
The number of calories burned by man, is divided into 3 factors: the number of sleep, number of steps, the ambient temperature. While the first two factors are in some way involved in similar applications, it is the third most innovating and close a supply to the most accurate rezults.

### Actuality
Research and development of applications are among the most relevant topics in the current time, because over time, increase the number of people with obesity. For example, in Russian percentage of people suffering from overweight or obese is 24.9%. Therefore, in order to deal with this fairly widespread global problem, it is necessary to take some measures, one of which is this application.


### The importance and novelty
It is currently unique to this application is not because it uses the largest possible number of factors affecting the accuracy of measurement of calories burned, and Brings in the lives of ordinary people a little aspiration and positive. Also, the app is simple enough to understand, neresurso—ëmkim and energy efficient, as after prolonged inactivity background application activity is suspended and the resumption of activity going again, therefore, on the basis of pilot experience, maximized applications for easy assimilation, and energy efficiency, in terms of novelty, really the first of its kind.


### The results of the study
From the development of applications a large number of different materials and the formulas were used to facilitate the creation of applications that are much more accurately calculates the number of calories burned and giving hope to many people who are obese, the chance for a speedy recovery. According to the above survey, at least 86% of people are really interested in this application.
