Weather-connected pedometer
Autor: Stukalov Denis
Goal: to develop innovative energy-efficient application pedometer to count calories using meteoservisov weather data.
Tasks: examine existing measurement algorithms steps and distance using sensors embedded in the smartphone (gyroscope, accelerometer). To study the essence of Harris Benedict formula and use it to calculate the total amount of calories burned, depending on the duration of sleep, number of steps you've taken, and most importantly, on the ambient temperature.
